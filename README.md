A Lisp-like interpreter. I'm an F# novice and this a project I'm doing for learning. 

The goal is to have a minimalistic but still usable (in some obscure scenario) Lisp. I think it would be cool to implement something up ot the R5RS spec, but more likely I won't go that far and this Lisp will be even smaller.
