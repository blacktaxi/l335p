=====

A Lisp-like interpreter.

TODO:
* REPL :)
* multi-line strings can't be lexed!
* recursive definitions are not working! and general code-smell around funcLet
* see if I can refactor built-in function definitions -- maybe make call arguments check common
* review and maybe refactor the stuff related to DelayedValues, forcing, etc.
* add integration tests; some unit tests, but low on priority
* floating point arithmetic
* code as data? should already be there but I'm in doubt
